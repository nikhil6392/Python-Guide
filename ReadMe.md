# 🐍 Writing Effective Python

![Effective Python](public/effective-python.png)

A curated guide and collection of notes, examples, and principles for **writing clean, efficient, and maintainable Python code**.  
This project is inspired by *best practices*, *Zen of Python*, and real-world coding experience.

---

## ✨ Key Principles
- **Readability counts** – Write code that others (and future you) can understand.  
- **Simplicity > Complexity** – Prefer straightforward solutions over clever hacks.  
- **Consistency** – Stick to common conventions (PEP8, docstrings, naming).  
- **Efficiency** – Use Pythonic idioms and built-in tools to write faster, cleaner code.  
- **Testing matters** – Write tests early to ensure long-term maintainability.
